# PhoneBook
A final project carried out for the Object Oriented Programming discipline in the Web and Mobile Development course at the IpLuso institution, where we should implement an application in Java, using the Java tools and features learned in class to implement a digital telephone directory.
The application should have:
1. At least one class that instantiates multiple objects within the code.
2. Have two files inside a package.
3. Have the ability to create and delete any element in the list, and
modify any of its attributes.
4. Ensure there are no conflicts in the list such as repeated elements
in the list.
5. It will be possible to search the elements in the list by any attribute, and show the remaining attributes of the element.
6. Save the list in a csv file, and retrieve it by reading the said
file.
7. Ensure that possible input or reading or writing errors to the disk are anticipated and identified by the type of errors
preventing uncontrolled termination of the application.
